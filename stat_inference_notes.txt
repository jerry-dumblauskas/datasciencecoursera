independent and identically distributed (iid)

Quantile = F(xa) = Alpha
Percentile = Quantile with alpha expressed as a percent
Median = 50th Percentile

PMF = discrete  Probability mass function (example die rolling)
PDF = continuous Probability density function (example blood pressue)

Estimand vs estimator

conditional prob = bayes

sensitivity (positive if positive)
specificity (neg if neg)

well, being sensitive is positive....specific is annoying and the opposite :)

positive predictive value

estimator estimates an estimand

x^2/4=.5

variance and its square root, the standard deviation

E(X^2)-E(X)^2
sum(dice_sqr*dice_high)-edh^2

mu=mean
sigma=standard deviation
standard deviation sigma/sqrt(n)
sigma^2=variance

E(X') = mu, where X' represents a sample mean and mu is the population mean.

The standard deviation of a statistic is called its standard error

qnorm for quantile norm

Suppose you have a normal distribution with mean 1020 and standard 
deviation of 50 and you want to compute the probability that the
associated random variable X > 1200. The easiest way to do this is to 
use R's pnorm function in which you specify the quantile (1200), 
the mean (1020) and standard deviation (50). You also must specify 
that the lower.tail is FALSE since we're asking for a probability 
that the random variable is greater than our quantile. 

ppois(3,2.5 * 4) !=  ppois(3,10) 


T dist

est +- tq + std err

t=(X'-mu)/(s/sqrt(n)) (has n-1 degrees of freedom)
this is
X' sample mean
mu = hypothised value (mean)
s = standard dev
n = number of observations

 Type I error REJECTS a TRUE null hypothesis H_0 and a 
 Type II error ACCEPTS a FALSE null hypothesis

 standard error=std dev/sqrt(number)

 The general rule for rejection is if sqrt(n) * ( X' - mu) / s > Z_{1-alpha}.

 Power = 1 - B  (B = type 2 error)

So we know that the quantities mu_0 and alpha are specified 
by the test designer. In the statement 
1 - beta = Prob( X' > mu_0 +z_(1-alpha) * sigma/sqrt(n)) 
given mu_a > mu_0, mu_0 and alpha are specified, 
and X' depends on the data. The other four quantities,
(beta, sigma, n, and mu_a), are all unknown.


The p-value is "the probability under the null hypothesis 
of obtaining evidence as or more extreme than your test 
statistic (obtained from| your observed data) in the 
direction of the alternative hypothesis."
