independent and identically distributed (iid)

Quantile = F(xa) = Alpha
Percentile = Quantile with alpha expressed as a percent
Median = 50th Percentile

PMF = discrete  Probability mass function (example die rolling)
PDF = continuous Probability density function (example blood pressue)

Estimand vs estimator

conditional prob = bayes

sensitivity (positive if positive)
specificity (neg if neg)

well, being sensitive is positive....specific is annoying and the opposite :)


positive predictive value

estimator estimates an estimand

x^2/4=.5

variance and its square root, the standard deviation

E(X^2)-E(X)^2
sum(dice_sqr*dice_high)-edh^2

mu=mean
sigma=standard deviation
standard deviation sigma/sqrt(n)
sigma^2=variance

E(X') = mu, where X' represents a sample mean and mu is the population mean.

The standard deviation of a statistic is called its standard error

qnorm for quantile norm

Suppose you have a normal distribution with mean 1020 and standard 
deviation of 50 and you want to compute the probability that the
associated random variable X > 1200. The easiest way to do this is to 
use R's pnorm function in which you specify the quantile (1200), 
the mean (1020) and standard deviation (50). You also must specify 
that the lower.tail is FALSE since we're asking for a probability 
that the random variable is greater than our quantile.
